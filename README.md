# Sorting Visualizer & Complexity Lab

An interactive web application that visualizes sorting algorithms with AI-powered complexity analysis, gamification features, and educational content.

## Features

- **7 Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, and Counting Sort
- **AI Time Complexity Analysis**: Detailed mathematical breakdown of algorithm performance
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time bar charts showing sorting process
- **GIF Export**: Download animated GIFs of sorting algorithms
- **Gamification**: Challenges and achievement badges
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: Detailed walkthrough of each algorithm
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between themes
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Chart.js for data visualization
- GIF.js for animated exports
- Local Storage for persistence
